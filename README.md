Nobul Todo List

Very simple Todo List that saves to the browser's local repository. GUI developed using jQuery Mobile. HTML5 is used for 
Importing/Exporting functionality. Exported data is in JSON format. Imported data should also be in JSON format.

The idea was to be able to save user data to the user specified environment like Dropbox and not be dependent on any server. In fact, this can be run locally through the broswer as no hosting server is required.

Developed using MS Visual Studio 2012, but solution and build files can be ignored as nothing inherent in VS is required to run or test.
